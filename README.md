This e-commerce webiste was made for an assignment during my third year at the University of Pisa. The main task was to create a website using only the standards: HTML 4.01, CSS 2.1 and PHP 4 and also simple editors like Notepad++ and Sublime.

Inside the folder called "inclusi" there are some files that contain some code shared by most pages of the website. The extension is php so that no changes would be needed in the future to add dynamic behaviours.

Inside the folder called "inclusiPHP" there are some files containing functions used to connect to the database and modify data before displaying them.

The file javascript/getElementsByClassName-1.0.1.js was taken from http://www.robertnyman.com
The file javascript/cookies.js was taken from  http://techpatterns.com

The idea behind the sticky footer was taken from http://ryanfait.com/sticky-footer

Use the file finale.sql to create and populate the database.

You can't actually buy any item. You need to use Goolge CheckOut and change just some lines of code. In the code on GitHub a boolean variable is used to simulate the payment.

You can see a live version of the website at the following address http://ladymcreazioni.altervista.org/
